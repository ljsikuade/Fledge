# Beginner Tasks for Fledge

1. I'm still not happy with the styling, and could use some input on this.
   Feel free to post styling suggestions of all sorts!

2. There's currently a bug on the dropdown menu, wherein it doesn't always display
   the correct category. Squash it!

3. Currently logging in has limited functionality attached to it. You can see which repositories you own
   but can't yet configure them for the app. I'd love to see ideas on this.

In the works:

- Configuring which branch Fledge looks on.

- Currently 'Hot' isn't completed. A solution that measures popularity in-app would be appreciated.

4. A logo would be great. I was thinking something bird-themed.
